# PokemonPokedexAnalysis

Tools Used: Python · SQL Server · Power BI · DAX

This project explores and analyzes a comprehensive dataset of Pokémon to uncover insights related to type distribution, base stats, evolution patterns, and battle potential.

- Data Preparation: Used Python (Pandas, NumPy) to clean and transform the raw dataset. SQL Server was used to store and manage the data, enabling efficient querying and normalization of Pokémon attributes.
- Data Modeling: Designed relational tables in SQL Server to support evolution chains, types, and stat metrics. Created views and complex SQL queries to support analytical use cases.
- Visual Analytics: Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with custom visuals to explore type matchups, average stats by generation, and legendary vs. non-legendary comparisons. Used DAX to create calculated measures such as average base stats, rarity scores, and type effectiveness ratings.
- Key Insights: Revealed trends in stat distribution across generations, identified underrepresented types, and created filters to compare Pokémon by primary/secondary type, generation, and legendary status.

This project demonstrates end-to-end data handling — from ETL and data modeling to insight delivery through dynamic reporting — showcasing my skills in data analysis, visualization, and BI tool integration.
